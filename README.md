#Updating tidal to 0.8.2

*I had been using 0.5.3 for the extramuros evolving code project as detailed in the evomusart paper*

Following http://tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html

update cabal *before* running the install - then you'll get the latest version

###sc 3.7

I'm running Lubuntu 14.10 and I'm having problems both installing sc3.7 using apt-get and trying to build from source. 

I've raised an issue in the tidal discussion form about this (), but no luck yet

###sc 3.6.6

This is the version that Ubuntu installs. There are instructions on getting tidal working with this version on the superdirt github page:
